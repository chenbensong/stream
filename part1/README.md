Start a Spark Cluster
From the terminal: cd /home/workspace/spark/sbin

Type: ./start-master.sh

Watch for a message similar to this: Logging to /home/workspace/spark/logs/spark--org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master-1-5a00814ba363.out

Copy the path to your log, for example: /home/workspace/sparklogs/logs/spark--org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master-1-5a00814ba363.out

Type: cat [path to log]

Look for a message like this: Starting Spark master at spark://5a00814ba363:7077

Copy the Spark URI, for example: spark://5a00814ba363:7077

Type: ./start-slave.sh [Spark URI]

Create a hello world Spark application and submit it to the cluster
Complete the hellospark.py application (be sure to click File Save when done)

From the terminal type: cd /home/workspace/spark/bin

Type: ./spark-submit /home/workspace/hellospark.py

Watch for the output at the end for the counts
